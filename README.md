# aframe360navigation
This repository applies link traversal concept on 360 degree images. As 360 degree images 4 images of the river Rhine close to Cologne/Rodenkirchen in Germany was used to create the aframe 360 degree navigation example. The objective of this repository is to provide a basic example for Wikiversity learning resource for 3D modelling. The link traversal approach runs offline in a browser. For creating your 360 degree image you can use Hugin or e.g. specific dual fish eye cameras. See repository HuginSample, Wikiversity Learning Resource about 3D modelling and Aframe.
